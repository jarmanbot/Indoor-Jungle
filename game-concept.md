# Indoor Jungle: Web3 Plant Game Concept

## Overview
"Indoor Jungle" is a virtual plant collecting and nurturing game where players start in a small apartment and work their way up to luxury homes while buying, selling, and caring for plants. The game connects to the real plant care app to create a seamless experience between virtual and real-world plant care, using the LVS token ("leaves") as its in-game currency.

## Core Gameplay Loop

### Starting Point
- Players begin in a rented 1-bedroom apartment with a single starter plant
- Limited space for plant placement and growth
- Basic tools for plant care (watering can, basic fertilizer)

### Player Progression
1. **Care for plants** - Regular watering, fertilizing, and monitoring based on real-world plant care data
2. **Buy and sell plants** - Marketplace for trading plants with other players using in-game currency or crypto tokens
3. **Complete challenges** - Daily/weekly plant care tasks that earn rewards
4. **Upgrade living space** - From rental apartment → owned condo → house → luxury home with greenhouse

### Economy
- **Plant NFTs**: Each virtual plant, pot, and tool is a unique NFT with specific traits
- **LVS Token (Leaves)**: In-game ERC-20 token currency for purchasing plants, tools, accessories, and property upgrades
- **Real-world connection**: Virtual plants can mirror your real plants from the care app

## Integration with Plant Care App

### Data Flow
- **Real to Virtual**: Real plant care data from the app influences the health and growth of virtual plants
- **Virtual to Real**: Game achievements can unlock features in the real-world plant care app
- **Shared Plant Database**: Plant information, care routines, and growth patterns shared between platforms

### Shared Features
- Plant catalog and information
- Care reminders and schedules
- Growth tracking and history
- User profiles and achievements

## Technical Framework

### Web3 Components
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum, Polygon, or Solana for NFTs and token transactions
- **Smart Contracts**: For NFT trading, property ownership, and marketplace functionality
- **Wallet Integration**: Connection to crypto wallets for purchasing and trading

### Game Engine
- Web-based 3D environment using Three.js or similar technology
- Mobile-compatible responsive design matching the plant care app

## Monetization
- **NFT Sales**: Primary and secondary sales of plant NFTs
- **Property Upgrades**: Purchases of virtual real estate
- **Premium Tools**: Special fertilizers, decorative pots, rare plants
- **Subscription**: Premium features across both platforms
